Description

Consumers utilize social media platforms, such as Twitter, to narrate their positive and negative experiences with products and services. A company needs to be able to collect, analyze, and respond to these comments in order to improve their customer relationships and protect their brand’s reputation.

In 2019, over one and a half billion passengers traveled by airplane. Given its vast size and scope, the airline industry would benefit from the ability to quickly analyze tweets.

By using Support Vector Machine and Naïve Bayes, this project analyzes tweets for sentiment.
